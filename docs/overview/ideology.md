# ðŸ’¡ Ideology

Pukima loved creating Discord Servers. With that came the question: "What bots do I use?". 

He invited multiple bots, since not every bot had all the features or certain features were locked behind a pay- or votewall. 

So he started creating his own little bot doing everything he needed. Then he created a few other servers over the years and the bot couldn't keep up with the changes because everything was too custom. 

He needed something which he can easily setup no matter in which server he was. 

That's when Tako was born.
