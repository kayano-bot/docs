# ðŸ’¡ What we do

Pukima, our Founder, loved creating Discord Servers and also with it came the question: "What bots do I use?". He invited multiple bots (around 10), since not every bot had all the features or certain features were locked behind a pay- or votewall. So he started creating his own little bot doing everything he needed. Then he created a few other servers over the years and the bot couldn't keep up with the changes because everything was too custom. He needed something which he can easily setup no matter in which server he was. That's when Tako was born.

We work really hard to making the Discord Experience a great experience! No more searching or inviting and setting up multiple bots. One bot. All features. All that without any pay- or votewalls. It just works!

Over the last few months we added over 40 new features. Gained 43k+ users and 85+ servers. Everything is also the highest quality possible and our Design is similar to Discord's Design itself, to make it fit in every server.
